 Terms of Service

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to our Discord bot sniper. This document constitutes the Terms of Service ("Terms") governing the use of our Discord bot sniper ("the Bot"). By using the Bot, you agree to these Terms.

## 2. Data Storage, Security, and Deletion
The Bot has a feature that stores Guild ID(s) for anti-ghost ping. When this feature is enabled, it stores the server ID. When this feature is disabled, it deletes the stored server ID. The Bot does not store any other personal data. We ensure that the data we store is secure and used solely for the purpose of providing the services of the Bot(Sniper). We do not use this data for any other purposes.

## 3. Changes to the Terms
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
